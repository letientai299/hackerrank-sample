/**
 * This package ("hr.introduction") contains solutions for the challenges in
 * this category: https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java/java-introduction
 *
 * What is a package-info.java? You can read about it file here:
 * https://www.intertech.com/Blog/whats-package-info-java-for/
 *
 * Here's a short summary: this file contains document and other information
 * about a java package, for example:
 *
 * <p/> - What is the purpose of the code under this package;
 * <p/> - How to use the code;
 * <p/> - Where can users look for help, external site, document;
 * <p/> - ...
 *
 * Now, put the cursor at the word "introduction" in the last line of this file,
 * and press Ctrl-Q (Quick Documentation). Get the idea?
 *
 * <p/> Javadoc tool can use this file to generate a good looking document
 * website about the source code, for example:
 *
 * http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/
 *
 * That site is generated from java source code, you can take a look at 2
 * links:
 *
 * <p/>- The source code: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/2.x/src/main/java/io/reactivex/CompletableEmitter.java
 * <p/>- The generated html page: http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/CompletableEmitter.html
 *
 * For now, don't care too much about how to write and generate such html
 * pages.
 * Focus on the code until you be able to write much more code.
